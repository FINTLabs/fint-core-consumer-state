# Fint Core Consumer State

This project is a RESTful API designed to manage and validate consumer deployment information for specific domains, packages, and organizations. It provides basic CRUD operations (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE) for handling consumer state data, along with additional data validation and component/resource management capabilities.

## Overview
The Consumer State API enables tracking and updating consumer configurations across various domains, packages, and organizations, allowing you to define which resources are available, writeable, and cacheable for each consumer. With this API, you can:

- Retrieve a list of all consumer configurations
- Add new consumer configurations
- Update existing consumers with partial or complete updates
- Delete consumer configurations
